### Its is a school project. This application shows the latest information of weather upto 10 days. I have used yahoo weather api. Link to the api is [this](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/).
### I have used many modren technologies in this project. Name of these technologies are listed below.
1. Gulp

### In this application i have used Revealing Moduel Pattren as design pattren. _init(), render(), getDetail() are the main function that i have used.
